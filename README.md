Welcome to Koinx App Vite! This application allows you to fetch cryptocurrency data using the CoinGecko API. It is built using Vite, a blazing fast frontend build tool that provides an extremely fast development experience.

## Getting Started

Production Deployment
When deploying the application for production, you may encounter router issues. To resolve these issues, you need to add a configuration file specific to your deployment platform.

For Vercel Deployment
If you are deploying to Vercel, add a vercel.json file to the root of your project. This file should contain the necessary configuration for Vercel's routing system.

For Netlify Deployment
If you are deploying to Netlify, add a netlify.toml file to the root of your project. This file should contain the necessary configuration for Netlify's routing system.

Both of these configuration files are already included in this repository for your convenience.

Fetching Cryptocurrency Data
By default, the application fetches Bitcoin data. To fetch data for a specific cryptocurrency, simply append the coin ID to the end of the URL. You can find the coin IDs in the CoinGecko documentation.

For example:

To fetch Bitcoin data: http://localhost:5173/get/
To fetch data for another cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum): http://localhost:5173/get/ethereum
